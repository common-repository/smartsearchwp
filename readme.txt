Chatbot with ChatGPT for intuitive customer interaction and conversational search on WordPress. Quick and easy interface.


== Description ==

Advanced Chatbot with ChatGPT for Intuitive Customer Interaction and Smart Search on WordPress. Quick interface for relevant results.

[SmartSearchWP](https://www.smartsearchwp.com/) is a powerful natural language processing tool for websites. It offers relevant search results through an intuitive interface and customizable settings, enhancing user experience.

Please note that the chatbot will only use the context provided by the user in its responses.

Administrators can now customize the chatbot's context by selecting which pages to include or exclude. This ensures that the chatbot only provides information that is relevant to your website.

The chatbot uses OpenAI as a third-party service to generate its answers.
